# test-repository
Just a test repository to experiment with some internal work at GitHub :octocat:

## First feature
- Testing push hook job system ðŸŽ‰
- Wow, it is working, lets generate some more data to see idle times and where time is spent
- Checking if all db clusters are affected equally
  - Definitely not, will I get lucky and get some throttling generated stats?
- No errors on the throttling side :(, where are the errors when you need them? ðŸ˜‚ It's all good I guess ðŸ˜„
- Checking now if we have some errors. Gaining confidence ðŸ’ª

## Second feature
- Testing now that stats make it to the data warehouse
  - Will they?
